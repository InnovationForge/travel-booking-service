# travel-booking-service (TBS)
A travel booking API that provides information about flights, hotels, and car rentals for different destinations.

## TBS Solution design overview
Developing a travel booking service that provides information about flights, hotels, and car rentals for different destinations can be a complex but rewarding project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:

* Data Modeling: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like Destination, Flight, Hotel, CarRental, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* Data Storage: Choose a database solution to store your data. Spring Boot supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Select the one that suits your needs and configure the data source.
* Flight Integration: Integrate with flight APIs or services to fetch flight information. Use these APIs to retrieve data like flight schedules, availability, prices, and seat maps. Implement functionality to search for flights based on criteria like origin, destination, date, and passenger count.
* Hotel Integration: Integrate with hotel APIs or services to fetch hotel information. Use these APIs to retrieve data like hotel availability, prices, amenities, and room types. Implement functionality to search for hotels based on criteria like destination, check-in/out dates, and guest count.
* Car Rental Integration: Integrate with car rental APIs or services to fetch car rental information. Use these APIs to retrieve data like car availability, prices, vehicle types, and rental policies. Implement functionality to search for car rentals based on criteria like destination, pick-up/drop-off dates, and passenger count.
* Booking and Payment: Implement booking functionality for flights, hotels, and car rentals. Allow users to select their desired options, provide passenger details, and process payments securely. Consider integrating with payment gateways to handle online transactions.
* User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for your travel booking service. Create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, develop a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* User Management: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. You can also include features like user profiles, booking history, and saved preferences.
* Search and Filtering: Build search and filtering functionality to allow users to refine their search results based on criteria such as price range, ratings, amenities, flight timings, and car types. Implement sorting options to enhance the user experience.
* Booking Management: Develop a dashboard or functionality to manage bookings. Allow users to view and modify their bookings, access booking details, and receive booking confirmations via email or notifications.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* Deployment: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Remember to handle security aspects like data protection, secure communication, and secure payment processing. Also, comply with any legal requirements or regulations related to the travel industry.

This outline should provide you with a starting point for developing your Travel Booking Service. Make sure to explore Spring Boot documentation and the documentation of the APIs you integrate with for detailed implementation guidance. Good luck with your project!
